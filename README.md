## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic programming-based prediction engine
- Raw weather data analysis from `.csv`
- Web-based interface with HTML/CSS/JS
- Executable helper tools (`ReadExp.exe`)
- Full documentation in PDF format

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **C++** for core logic
- **JavaScript** for frontend interactivity
- **HTML/CSS** for layout and design
- **CSV** for dataset handling
- **Dynamic Programming** for algorithmic prediction

## 📄 How to Run

1. **Backend (C++)**
   - Compile `weather_predictor.cpp` and `ReadExp.cpp` using a C++ compiler like `g++`.
   - Run the compiled executables to generate predictions based on `raw weather data.csv`.

2. **Frontend**
   - Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
   - Ensure `style.css` and `wether_prid.js` are in the same directory.

> **Note:** The JavaScript file name `wether_prid.js` may have a typo. Consider renaming it to `weather_pred.js` for clarity.

## 📊 Dataset

- Located in: `raw weather data.csv`
- Format: Standard comma-separated values with historical weather patterns
